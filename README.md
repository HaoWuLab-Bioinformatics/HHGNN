## Overview
The folder "**data**" contains all data used.  
The folder "**dhg**" contains code for building hypergraphs.  
The folder "**layers**" contains code for each layer.  
The folder "**manifolds**" contains implementation code for hyperbolic space,Euclidean space and poincare space.  
The folder "**models**" contains the implementation code of the VAE framework.  
The folder "**optimizers**" contains optimizations to the Riemannian Adam algorithm.  
The folder "**src**" contains code for parsing command line arguments and providing configuration information for the program.  
The folder "**utils**" contains function definition, data set import and other codes.
